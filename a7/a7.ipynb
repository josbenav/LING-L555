He gained a foothold for freedom, and at the age of 17, just a year older than his grandson who is up there with him today— and his son, who is a West Point graduate and a veteran—at 17, Jack Lucas became the youngest Marine in history and the youngest soldier in this century to win the Congressional Medal of Honor.

      "Paragraph 1: During our first 3 years, we have joined bipartisan efforts to restore protection of the law to unborn children. Now, I know this issue is very controversial. But unless and until it can be proven that an unborn child is not a living human being, can we justify assuming without proof that it isn't? No one has yet offered such proof; indeed, all the evidence is to the contrary. We should rise above bitterness and reproach, and if Americans could come together in a spirit of understanding and helping, then we could find positive solutions to the tragedy of abortion.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: The question of abortion grips our nation. Abortion is either the taking of a human life or it isn't. And if it is—and medical technology is increasingly showing it is—it must be stopped. It is a terrible irony that while some turn to abortion, so many others who cannot become parents cry out for children to adopt. We have room for these children. We can fill the cradles of those who want a child to love. And tonight I ask you in the Congress to move this year on legislation to protect the unborn.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Well, now we come to a family issue that we must have the courage to confront. Tonight, I call America—a good nation, a moral people—to charitable but realistic consideration of the terrible cost of abortion on demand. To those who say this violates a woman's right to control of her own body: Can they deny that now medical evidence confirms the unborn child is a living human being entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? Let us unite as a nation and protect the unborn with legislation that would stop all Federal funding for abortion and with a human life amendment making, of course, an exception where the unborn child threatens the life of the mother. Our Judeo-Christian tradition recognizes the right of taking a life in self-defense. But with that one exception, let us look to those others in our land who cry out for children to adopt. I pledge to you tonight I will work to remove barriers to adoption and extend full sharing in family life to millions of Americans so that children who need homes can be welcomed to families who want them and love them.\n",

In terms of real buying power, by next year that minimum wage will be at a 40-year low. That's not my idea of how the new economy ought to work.\n",

      "Paragraph 1: Now, to make sure there is a full nine member Supreme Court to interpret the law, to protect the rights of all Americans, I urge the Senate to move quickly and decisively in confirming Judge Anthony Kennedy to the highest Court in the land and to also confirm 27 nominees now waiting to fill vacancies in the Federal judiciary.\n",
      "Paragraph 2: Police, prosecutors, and prevention programs, as good as they are, they can't work if our court system doesn't work. Today, there are large numbers of vacancies in our Federal courts. Here is what the Chief Justice of the United States wrote: \"Judicial vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.\" I simply ask the United States Senate to heed this plea and vote on the highly qualified judicial nominees before you, up or down.\n",
      "Paragraph 3: Because courts must always deliver impartial justice, judges have a duty to faithfully interpret the law, not legislate from the bench. As President, I have a constitutional responsibility to nominate men and women who understand the role of courts in our democracy and are well-qualified to serve on the bench, and I have done so. The Constitution also gives the Senate a responsibility: Every judicial nominee deserves an up-or-down vote.\n",

    "Looking at the graph above, I chose two topics: one about taxes, healthcare, and budget, and another about America, the nation, and freedom. The first topic, \"tax, health, budget, care,\" goes up and down over time but spikes in the late 1990s, early 2000s, and again around the 2020s. These rises make sense when we think about what was happening at those times. For example, in the 1990s, there were big discussions around the budget and healthcare, and in the 2000s, George W. Bush focused a lot on tax cuts. The big spike in the 2020s might be related to COVID-19 and all the talk about healthcare and the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second topic, \"America, nation, world, freedom,\" stays somewhat steady but has noticeable jumps, especially after 2001. This is likely due to 9/11 and the War on Terror, where national security and freedom were imporant in the history of the USA. There’s also a rise in the 2010s, which could be linked to discussions about America's global role under Obama and Trump. Overall, these topics seem to describe fairly well what was happening in the real world during these times."

    "The topic distribution analysis shows ideological division between the Democratic and Republican parties, illustrated in the priorities and policies.

    "Conversely, Republican texts tend to concentrate on national security and military themes, as evidenced by the balanced representation in topics related to nuclear issues and wars. The Republicans also show a focus on crime, especially mentioning gun-related topics, although with lower representation than Democrats. This reveals Republicans' emphasis on traditional values and law enforcement. While both parties share some concerns, their narratives diverge significantly, with Democrats prioritizing social equity and Republicans focusing on security and economic conservatism."

    "Reducing the `top_n_words` value in the BERTopic model from 10 to 5 changes the topics significantly. With fewer words (e.g., 5), the topics become more concise, selecting the most important terms. For example, while the original setup included broader keywords like \"jobs\" and \"government,\" the new configuration focuses on fewer phrases, like those related to \"health\" and \"care\" only. However, while this shift can make the topics clearer, we might lose some other words that can be synonyms or antonyms but related to the topic.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, changing the value of the `top_n_words` affects how topics are labeled and represented. With more words, topics can be more descriptive, capturing more words that are associated to the topic. However, with only five words, the topics risk oversimplifying complex ideas. While this adjustment can lead to a clearer understanding of key themes, it may sacrifice some in depth information and classification. This change is somewhat similar to modifying the `nr_topics`, as in the exercise above. "
